El testimonio es nuestra mayor fuente de creencias La gran mayoría de nuestras creencias han sido adquiridas partir de las palabras de otros través de la observación directa del mundo Una de las peculiaridades de la mayor parte de las creencias testimoniales es que son aceptadas sin ninguna deliberación consciente Mientras el testimonio sea consistente con nuestras creencias la fuente sea confiable la reacción más corriente es la aceptación automática de la información Thagard 2004 2005 Nuestra confianza en el testimonio de los demás es un requisito sólo para la construcción colectiva del conocimiento Hardwig 1985 1991 sino también para la interacción social en Sin embargo existen contextos en los que la aceptación apresurada de un testimonio falso puede tener consecuencias nefastas En contextos científicos legales políticos financieros entre otros se toman decisiones importantes se implementan políticas cruciales partir de las afirmaciones de otros En estos contextos la aceptación de un testimonio debe ser el resultado de un proceso de decisión basado en criterios objetivos de justificación Sin embargo existen dos objeciones al intento de justificar la aceptación de un testimonio Coady 1973 1992 La primera es que cualquier justificación será irremediablemente circular puesto que la inmensa mayoría de testimonios obtienen su justificación al menos en parte de evidencia de tipo testimonial La segunda es que nuestras inferencias acerca de la confiabilidad de ciertos tipos de testimonio nunca tendrán un apoyo inductivo lo suficientemente fuerte debido que los casos en los que un tipo de testimonio puede ser verificado directamente en la experiencia nunca serán lo suficientemente numerosos En este ensayo presento una solución al problema de cómo decidir racionalmente si un testimonio puede ser aceptado como evidencia probatoria en una investigación Mi propuesta que está basada en la teoría de revisión de creencias desarrollada por Levi 1984 1991 muestra que la aceptación justificada de un testimonio está basada en exactamente los mismos mecanismos de adquisición de creencias que operan en el caso de evidencias testimoniales al mismo tiempo la propuesta da cuenta de las particularidades que se presentan en el proceso de evaluación de una evidencia testimonial Mi tesis es que la decisión de aceptar un testimonio es un proceso que se cumple en dos etapas En la primera se busca una justificación pare el testimonio buscando todos los hechos que aumenten la probabilidad de que el testimonio sea verdadero es decir de que el testigo declarante esté reportando verídicamente un hecho La aceptación de estos hechos de su relación probabilística positiva con respecto al testimonio está basada en la búsqueda de un equilibrio entre su credibilidad su valor informativo En la segunda etapa se determina si la justificación obtenida en la primera es suficiente para la aceptación del testimonio de nuevo buscando encontrar un equilibrio entre su credibilidad la utilidad de la información que contiene en promover los intereses metas cognitivas del investigador

Wann ist Kohärenz ein Indiz für Wahrheit Können Informationsmengen immer entsprechend ihrer Kohärenz geordnet werden Welche Rolle spielt Kohärenz bei der Theoriewahl der Wissenschaft Unter welchen Umständen kann eine wissenschaftliche Theorie mit nur teilweise zuverlässigen Messinstrumenten bestätigt werden Ist die Belegvielfaltsthese wahr Warum sind übereinstimmende Aussagen unabhängiger Zeugen gewichtig Dies sind einige der Fragen die diesem Buch einem wahrscheinlichkeitstheoretischen Kontext und auf der Grundlage konkreter Modelle behandelt werden Darüber hinaus bietet das Buch eine elementare Einführung die Theorie der Bayesianischen Netzwerke und zeigt Verbindungen auf zu Debatten der Kognitionswissenschaft Tversky und Kahnemans Linda Sozialwahltheorie Condorcet Jury Theorem und Informatik Repräsentation von Glaubenssystemen Das Buch richtet sich alle die sich für die Anwendung wahrscheinlichkeitstheoretischer Methoden der Philosophie interessieren
Das Thema dieses Bandes ist die Frage ob die Wissenschaftstheorie eine normative Disziplin ist Zunächst überrascht die Frage denn für viele Wissenschaftstheoretiker ist die Antwort ein klares „ Ja sie halten es für einen Allgemeinplatz dass die Wissenschaftstheorie ein normatives Unternehmen ist Bei genauerem Hinsehen stellt sich jedoch heraus dass die Frage unterschiedliche Interpretationen zulässt die einzeln diskutiert werden müssen Dies geschieht im ersten Abschnitt Im zweiten Abschnitt suchen wir nach möglichen Erklärungen dafür warum die Wissenschaftstheorie bisher bei dem Projekt eine allseits akzeptable Methodologie wissenschaftlichen Schließens zu formulieren und zu begründen wenig Erfolg hatte Eine mögliche Erklärung für den ausbleibenden Erfolg ist der Partikularismus wonach Methoden keine allgemeine sondern nur eine lokale bereichsabhängige Gültigkeit haben Im dritten Abschnitt wollen wir Hand des Bayesianismus zeigen dass die Methodologie doch nicht schlecht da steht wie es zunächst den Anschein hat Der Bayesianismus ist für viele Wissenschaftstheoretiker der aussichtsreichste Kandidat für eine allgemeine Theorie induktiven Räsonierens Wir besprechen seine Vorzüge stellen aber auch dar welche Konzessionen er den Partikularismus machen muss
